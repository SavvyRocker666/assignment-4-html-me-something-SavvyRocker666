      <p>I love going to concerts. Music is one of my lifesavers. I've been to so many concerts that I can't even count to how many I've been to anymore. LOL.</p>
      <p>I love being surrounded by people who love the same kind of music and screaming/singing at the top of our lungs, it's one of the best feelings in the world.</p>
      <p>I've been going to concerts since I was 10 years old.</p>
      <p>I've met so many friends because of concerts. I've also met a lot of my favorite artists and learned a lot from them on how they write songs and got where they are and how to get there myself.</p>
